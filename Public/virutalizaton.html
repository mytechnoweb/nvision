    <h2>Core Concepts & Definitions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is Virtualization?</summary>
      <p>
        Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something—such as a server, desktop, storage device, operating system, or network resources. It allows multiple virtual systems to run on a single physical system, improving resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility. By abstracting hardware through software, virtualization enables organizations to reduce costs, simplify management, and increase efficiency.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Hypervisor</summary>
      <p>
        A hypervisor is a software layer that enables virtualization by allowing multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host. It manages the execution of virtual machines (VMs) and allocates resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare-metal), which runs directly on hardware, and Type 2 (hosted), which runs on top of an existing operating system.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Virtual Machine (VM)</summary>
      <p>
        A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs its own operating system and applications independently, using virtualized hardware resources provided by the hypervisor. VMs are isolated from each other, making them ideal for testing, development, and running multiple environments on a single physical server.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Containerization</summary>
      <p>
        Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that packages applications and their dependencies into containers. Unlike VMs, containers share the host operating system kernel, making them faster and more efficient. Technologies like Docker and Kubernetes have popularized containerization for deploying scalable, portable, and consistent applications across environments.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Snapshot</summary>
      <p>
        A snapshot is a saved state of a virtual machine at a specific point in time. It captures the VM’s disk, memory, and configuration, allowing administrators to revert to that state if needed. Snapshots are useful for backup, testing, and recovery scenarios, but excessive use can impact performance and storage.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)</summary>
      <p>
        VDI is a technology that hosts desktop environments on a centralized server and delivers them to end users over a network. Users interact with virtual desktops as if they were local, while the actual processing happens on the server. VDI enhances security, simplifies management, and supports remote work and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Cloud Virtualization</summary>
      <p>
        Cloud virtualization extends traditional virtualization to cloud environments, enabling dynamic provisioning of virtual resources over the internet. Cloud providers use virtualization to offer scalable infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), allowing customers to deploy and manage virtual servers, storage, and networks without owning physical hardware.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Benefits of Virtualization</summary>
      <p>
        Virtualization offers numerous benefits including reduced hardware costs, improved disaster recovery, simplified testing and development, enhanced scalability, and better resource utilization. It also supports green IT initiatives by lowering energy consumption and physical space requirements.
