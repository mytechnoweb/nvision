    <h1>ITIL Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>Framework for delivering high-quality IT services aligned with business needs</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is ITIL?</summary>
      <p>
        ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a globally recognized framework for IT service management (ITSM). It provides best practices for delivering IT services that align with business goals. ITIL helps organizations improve efficiency, reduce risk, and enhance customer satisfaction by standardizing service delivery and support processes.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>IT Service Management (ITSM)</summary>
      <p>
        ITSM refers to the implementation and management of quality IT services that meet business needs. It includes planning, delivery, support, and improvement of IT services. ITIL is one of the most widely adopted ITSM frameworks, offering structured guidance for managing the entire service lifecycle.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Value Co-Creation</summary>
      <p>
        ITIL emphasizes value co-creation, where service providers and consumers collaborate to create value. Instead of viewing IT as a support function, ITIL promotes active engagement between stakeholders to ensure services deliver meaningful outcomes that support business objectives.
      </p>
    </details>

    <h2>ITIL Practices & Processes</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Incident Management</summary>
      <p>
        Incident Management focuses on restoring normal service operations as quickly as possible after an interruption. It minimizes the impact on business operations and ensures agreed service levels are maintained. Common tools include ticketing systems and automated alerts.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Problem Management</summary>
      <p>
        Problem Management aims to identify and resolve the root causes of incidents. It involves proactive analysis, documentation, and long-term solutions to prevent recurring issues. Techniques include root cause analysis (RCA) and known error databases (KEDB).
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Change Enablement</summary>
      <p>
        Formerly known as Change Management, this practice ensures changes to IT services are carried out in a controlled and coordinated manner. It reduces risk and disruption by assessing, approving, and scheduling changes through a formal process.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Request Management</summary>
      <p>
        This practice handles user requests for information, access, or standard services. Examples include password resets, software installations, or access to shared drives. Efficient request fulfillment improves user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Level Management</summary>
      <p>
        Service Level Management ensures that all services are delivered according to agreed-upon service level agreements (SLAs). It involves monitoring performance, reporting metrics, and negotiating realistic expectations between IT and business stakeholders.
      </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Service Lifecycle Stages</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Strategy</summary>
      <p>
        This stage defines the approach for delivering value through IT services. It includes understanding customer needs, defining service offerings, and aligning IT capabilities with business goals. Strategic planning ensures long-term success and relevance.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Design</summary>
      <p>
        Service Design focuses on creating new services or improving existing ones. It includes designing processes, technologies, architectures, and documentation to ensure services are efficient, secure, and scalable. Key outputs include service design packages and policies.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Transition</summary>
      <p>
        This stage ensures that new or changed services are deployed smoothly into the live environment. It includes change management, release planning, testing, and validation. The goal is to minimize disruption and ensure service readiness.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Operation</summary>
      <p>
        Service Operation is responsible for delivering and supporting services in real time. It includes incident management, request fulfillment, and monitoring. The focus is on maintaining stability while responding to user needs effectively.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Continual Improvement</summary>
      <p>
        Continual Improvement identifies opportunities to enhance services, processes, and performance. It uses metrics, feedback, and analysis to drive incremental and transformational changes. The goal is to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and deliver better value.
      </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Common ITIL Terms & Tools</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Configuration Management Database (CMDB)</summary>
      <p>
        A CMDB is a centralized repository that stores information about IT assets and their relationships. It supports decision-making, impact analysis, and change planning. Accurate CMDB data is critical for effective service management.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Service Catalog</summary>
      <p>
        The Service Catalog is a structured list of all available IT services offered to users. It includes descriptions, pricing, SLAs, and request procedures. A well-maintained catalog improves transparency and user experience.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</summary>
      <p>
        KPIs are measurable values that indicate how effectively IT services are achieving objectives. Examples include incident resolution time, SLA compliance, and customer satisfaction scores. KPIs guide continual improvement and performance management.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>ITIL Tools</summary>
      <p>
        Popular ITIL tools include ServiceNow, BMC Remedy, Freshservice, and Jira Service Management. These platforms support ticketing, automation, reporting, and workflow management aligned with ITIL practices.
